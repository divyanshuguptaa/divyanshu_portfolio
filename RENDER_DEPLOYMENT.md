## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Free Tier Limitations:
- App "sleeps" after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request after sleep takes 30-60 seconds to wake up
- Full CSV download from Google Drive may take 1-2 minutes on first load
- This is normal for free tier!

### If Google Drive Blocks Downloads:
If you get errors about too many downloads:

**Option 1:** Make file publicly accessible:
1. In Google Drive, right-click file ‚Üí Share
2. Change to "Anyone with the link can view"
3. Verify permissions

**Option 2:** Use Dropbox instead:
1. Upload CSV to Dropbox
2. Get sharing link
3. Change `?dl=0` to `?dl=1` at the end
4. Use that as `CSV_URL`

## üéØ Expected Timeline

| Step | Time |
|------|------|
| Initial deployment (sample data) | 5-10 minutes |

| **Total** | **~15 minutes** |

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Dashboard not loading?
