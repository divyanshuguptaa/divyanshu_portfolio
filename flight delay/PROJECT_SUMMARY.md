## 💡 **USE THIS PROJECT TO ANSWER INTERVIEW QUESTIONS**

### **"Tell me about a complex visualization project you've built"**
> "I built an interactive flight delay analytics dashboard with 12 interconnected visualizations analyzing 10,000+ flights. It features real-time filtering across all charts, 3D animations, and a cyberpunk UI. Users can explore delays by carrier, time, route, and root cause through heatmaps, scatter plots, box plots, and more. The dashboard is built with Python, Plotly, and Dash, and showcases my ability to handle complex data storytelling with engaging user experiences."

### **"How do you approach dashboard design?"**
> "I start with understanding the user's questions—in this case, 'When should I fly?' and 'Which airline is best?' Then I choose the right chart types: heatmaps for time patterns, scatter plots for correlations, box plots for distributions. I add global filters so users can drill down, and include clear KPIs upfront. The 3D animated background and glassmorphism effects create visual interest without distracting from the data. Every interaction—hover, zoom, export—is intentional to support exploration."

### **"What's your process for making data accessible?"**
> "In my flight delay dashboard, I used color gradients (green=good, red=bad), clear labels, and hover tooltips. I added an 'About' section explaining technical terms like 'NAS' and 'on-time performance.' The visualizations are arranged by complexity—starting with simple trends, moving to correlation analysis. I also used familiar iconography like ✈️ and 🛫 to make it approachable while maintaining professional aesthetics."
