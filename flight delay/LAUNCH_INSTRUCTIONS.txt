📊 KPI CARDS (What They Mean)
================================================================================

Card 1: TOTAL FLIGHTS
        → Number of flights in filtered view
        
Card 2: AVERAGE DELAY
        → Mean arrival delay in minutes
        → Negative = early on average
        
Card 3: ON-TIME RATE
        → % within ±15 minutes of schedule
        → Target: 80%+ is good
        
Card 4: CANCELLATION RATE
        → % of flights cancelled
        → Industry average: 1-2%

================================================================================
💡 TIPS FOR BEST EXPERIENCE
================================================================================

1. START BROAD: View all data first (no filters)
2. EXPLORE: Use heatmap to find interesting patterns
3. DRILL DOWN: Apply filters to investigate specific cases
4. COMPARE: Use carrier filter to compare airlines
5. EXPORT: Download charts using camera icon

INTERESTING QUESTIONS TO EXPLORE:
- Which airline is most reliable? → Use Viz #2
- When are delays worst? → Use Viz #5 (heatmap)
- What causes most delays? → Use Viz #4
- Which routes are problematic? → Use Viz #7
- Are summer flights worse? → Use Month filter
