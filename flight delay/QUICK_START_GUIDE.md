## üéØ What to Expect

### Loading Time
- **Sample Dataset (10K rows)**: 2-5 seconds
- **Full Dataset (6-7M rows)**: 30-60 seconds

### Initial View
You will see:
- ‚ú® **3D Animated Plane Background** - Planes flying across screen
- üìä **4 KPI Cards** at top - Key metrics
- üéõÔ∏è **Global Filters Panel** - Dropdown menus and slider
- üìà **12 Interactive Visualizations** - Arranged in grid layout

---

## üéõÔ∏è How to Use Filters

### **Global Filters** (affect all 12 visualizations)
1. **Carrier Filter** - Select airline (e.g., "AA", "DL", "UA") or "All Carriers"
2. **Month Filter** - Choose specific month or "All Months"
3. **Day Filter** - Pick day of week or "All Days"
4. **Delay Range Slider** - Drag to set min/max delay range

### **Filter Behavior**
- All filters work **simultaneously**
- Changes apply **instantly** to all charts
- KPI cards update in **real-time**
- Reset by selecting "All" options

---

## üìä Understanding the 12 Visualizations

### **Row 1: Temporal Analysis**
1. **Monthly Trends** - See which months have worst delays
2. **Carrier Performance** - Compare airlines (lower is better)

### **Row 2: Delay Analysis**
3. **Delay Categories** - Breakdown: Early, On-Time, Delayed, etc.
4. **Root Causes** - See if delays are weather, carrier, or air traffic

### **Row 3: Heat Analysis**
5. **Day/Hour Heatmap** - Find worst times to fly (darker = worse)

### **Row 4: Routes & Distance**
6. **Distance vs Delay** - Are longer flights more delayed?
7. **Worst Routes** - Which city pairs have most delays

### **Row 5: Cancellations & Performance**
8. **Cancellation Rates** - Which carriers cancel most
9. **On-Time Timeline** - Daily performance over the year

### **Row 6: Statistical Analysis**
10. **Box Plots** - See delay distributions and outliers
11. **State Performance** - Geographic patterns

### **Row 7: Operations**
12. **Taxi Times** - Ground operation efficiency

## üí° Pro Tips

### **For Best Performance**
- Start with sample dataset (already default)
- Apply filters to reduce data before exploring
- Use Chrome or Edge browser for best experience

### **For Deep Analysis**
1. Start with global view (no filters)
2. Identify patterns in monthly/heatmap charts
3. Focus on specific carrier or month
4. Drill down to problematic routes
5. Check root causes in attribution chart

### **Interesting Questions to Explore**
- Which airline is most reliable?
- Are summer flights more delayed?
- Do Friday flights have more delays?
- Which airports have longest taxi times?
- Are weather delays seasonal?
- Do longer flights correlate with more delays?

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Dashboard won't start**
- Check Python is installed: `python --version`
- Reinstall packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check CSV files are in same folder

### **"Module not found" error**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Browser shows "Can't reach page"**
- Wait 10-15 seconds after starting
- Try http://localhost:8050 instead
- Check console for "Dash is running" message

### **Dashboard is slow**
- You might be using full dataset (6-7M rows)
- Switch to sample: Line 30 in code, use `flight_data_2024_sample.csv`
- Close other browser tabs
- Apply filters to reduce data

### **Charts are blank**
- Your filters might be too restrictive
- Reset all filters to "All"
- Check console for error messages

---

## üéì Next Steps

### **Customize the Dashboard**
1. **Change Theme** - Edit color variables in code (lines 46-51)
2. **Add Visualizations** - Follow the pattern of existing viz functions
3. **Modify Filters** - Add new dropdown menus in layout section
4. **Use Full Dataset** - Change line 30 to load full CSV

### **Export Insights**
- Use camera icon on each chart to download PNG
- Take screenshots of entire dashboard
- Share URL with colleagues (if on same network)

---

## üìû Need Help?

### **Common Issues**
1. Port 8050 already in use:
   - Change port in last line: `port=8051`
   
2. Data not loading:
   - Check CSV file path in code (line 30)
   - Ensure CSV is in same folder as Python file

3. Filters not working:
   - Check browser console (F12) for errors
   - Refresh page (Ctrl + F5)
