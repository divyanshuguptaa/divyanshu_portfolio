        <h3>✈️ Flight Delay Analytics Dashboard 2024</h3>
        <a href="https://your-dashboard.onrender.com" target="_blank" class="project-link"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Problem: Build Failed**
**Solution:**
- Check `requirements.txt` has all dependencies
- Verify Python version compatibility
- Check build logs for specific error

### **Problem: App Crashes on Start**
**Solution:**
- Verify `Procfile` has correct command
- Check that `server = app.server` is in Python file
- Review application logs in Render dashboard

### **Problem: Dashboard Loads Slowly**
**Solution:**
- Free tier has cold starts (15-30 seconds)
- Upgrade to paid tier for faster performance
- Optimize data loading (use sample dataset)

### **Problem: CSV File Not Found**
**Solution:**
- Ensure CSV files are in same directory as Python file
- Check file paths in code (should be relative)
- Verify files were pushed to GitHub
